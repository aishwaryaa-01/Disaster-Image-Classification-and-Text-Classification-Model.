# Disaster-Image-Classification-and-Text-Classification-Model.

**Objective:**

   - Integrate the computer vision and NLP components into a cohesive system and deploy it as a web application.

#### Part 1: Computer Vision

  **Objective:**

   - Detect and classify disaster-related objects in images (e.g., fires, floods, damaged buildings, injured people).
   - Preprocess the images (e.g., resizing, normalization).

   - Implement a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) or use a pre-trained model (e.g., VGG16, ResNet50) for image classification.

   - Fine-tune the model to detect specific disaster-related objects.

   - Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall).

#### Part 2: Natural Language Processing (NLP)

**Objective:**

   - Analyze text from social media posts to detect and categorize disaster-related information (e.g., reports of damage, requests for help).
   - **Tasks:**

   - Preprocess the text data (e.g., tokenization, stop-word removal, stemming/lemmatization).

   - Implement text classification using traditional machine learning models (e.g., SVM, Random Forest) and compare with a deep learning model (e.g., LSTM, BERT).

   - Fine-tune the deep learning model to improve performance on the given dataset.

   - Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, F1-score).
